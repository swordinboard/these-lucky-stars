# Character Archetype

Choose a short character archetype description like "Sneaky Pirate" or "Lucky Pilot" to guide your choices. This archetype will not otherwise be referenced during play, but it should be a direct reflection of your character and allow you to give the table a quick answerr to the question "What are you playing?"

# Character Creation: Starting at Level One

Each character starts at level one with:
- Two traits
- One proficiency  
- One ability

Your GM may have you start with additional triaits, particularly if playing with racial traits.
