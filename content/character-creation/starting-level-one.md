# Character Creation: Starting at Level One

## Archetypes

Players should choose an Archetype for their character. An archetype is a short description such as "Sneaky Pirate" or "Lucky Pilot" to guide their choices. This archetype will not otherwise be referenced during play, but it should be a direct reflection of your character and allow you to give the table a quick answer to the question "What are you playing?"

## Rolling Attributes

## Calculating Stats

## Starting Features

Each character starts at level one with:
- Two traits
- One proficiency  
- One ability

Your GM may have you start with additional triaits, particularly if playing with racial traits.
