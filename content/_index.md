[Digital Character Sheet](/digitalcharactersheet.html)
This character sheet was made on a whim. It should have everything the basic paper sheet has. Check the READ ME  at the top for more details.

[Attribute Converter](/attributeconverter.html)
This converter generates comparable stat arrays based on probability and overall strength. It can be used to transfer between TLS test versions, as well as the most common D20 systems.

[Planet Name Generator](/planetnamegenerator.html)
I made this because I needed something setting specific and figured I might as well drop it here too. It generates planet codes, not so muhch names.
