Hello! Here you can find all the web apps for These Lucky Stars. Hopefully they get put yo good use.

Current major revisions and/or rewrite notes can be found [here](/content/docs/ohnothoughts.md). Smaller updates can be found in the discord, look for the latest rulebook document.

[Digital Character Sheet](/digitalcharactersheet.html)
This charcter sheet was made on a whim. It should have everything the basic paper sheet has. Check the READ ME  at the top for more details.

[Planet Name Generator](/planetnamegenerator.html)
I made this because I needed something setting specific and figured I might as well drop it here too. It generates planet codes, not so muh names.

[Attribute Converter](/attributeconverter.html)
This converter generates comparable stat arrays based on probability and overall strength. It can be used to transfer between TLS versions, and the most common D20 systems.
