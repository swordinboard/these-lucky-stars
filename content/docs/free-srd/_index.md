## These Lucky Stars

These Lucky Stars is a tabletop roleplaying game built for dynamic play balancing detail and speed.

### [Core Mechanics](/docs/free-srd/core-mechanics)
2d6 Resolution System: Roll 2d6, add your relevant attribute and modifiers, beat the target number

### [Eight Attributes](/docs/free-srd/attributes)
Four physical (STR, AGI, DEX, FORT) and four mental (KNO, INS, CHA, WILL).

## Flexible Character Creation
Build your character with traits, proficiencies, and abilities - no rigid classes.

### Tactical Combat
Defense and Vitality system with meaningful wounds and conditions.

## Design Philosophy
The system aims to be simple enough to learn quickly and detailed enough to cover most situations without getting bogged down. If you've played any other d20 or 2d6 system you should feel right at home.

## What's Free
All core mechanics are free and will remain free forever. The System Reference Document (SRD) contains everything you need to play and been made accesdible via this documentation site. Licensing information can be found [here](/docs/legal).

## What's Coming
Complete These Lucky Stars setting guides will include expanded character options, full equipment catalogs, vehicles and mechs, setting lore, and adventures. This premium content will be available through an upcoming Kickstarter.
