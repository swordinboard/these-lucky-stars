# Abilities

Abilities are special actions your character can take. They have the most variance in usage and effects. Some provide new actions, others modify existing actions, and some provide passive bonuses. Certain abilities can be taken multiple times, improving upon the original effect or number of uses.

Sometimes an additional selection needs to be made, such as a type of weapon or armor. This selection is made at the time of selecting the ability and is usually written in [brackets] beside the ability name.

If an ability has requirements that must be met before it can be selected, they are written in italics.
