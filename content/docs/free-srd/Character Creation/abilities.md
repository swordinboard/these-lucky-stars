## Core Combat

### Charge

For 4 AP you may rush at your enemies to deliver a powerful melee attack as a full action. You must move at least 10ft in a direct line toward your opponent, but may move up to double your movement speed. At the end of your movement make a standard melee attack at +2 ATK once within reach of them. The movement portion of this ability must be in a straight, uninterrupted line that does not pass over/under any obstacles or through difficult terrain.

### Agile Charge

*Charge, AGI 4, Level 3*

The movement of your Charge ability no longer needs to be in a straight line, though it still cannot pass over/under obstacles or through difficult terrain.

### Bash

*Charge, STR 3, AGI 3, Level 5*

Instead of making an attack at the end of your charge you may attempt to shove your opponent and displace them. Instead of making an attack make a contested grapple check at the end of your movement with a +4 bonus. If you win the grapple check your opponent is pushed backwards 5ft and you take their space. If they collide with a solid object they take 1d6+STR damage and you do not take their space.

### Improved Bash

*Charge, Bash, STR 5, AGI 3, Level 7*

Increase the displacement from your Bash by an additional 5ft for each 5pts the result of your contested grapple check was greater than your opponents.

### Defender

*FORT 2, Level 5*

You are particularly skilled at defending from melee attacks. Once per day (1/day) anytime a melee attack is declared against you while engaged in combat, you may double your current DEF until the beginning of your next turn. This ability must be activated before damage is rolled. You may select this ability multiple times to increase its usage by 1/day to a maximum of 3/day. This ability cannot be used if you have not yet acted in combat.
