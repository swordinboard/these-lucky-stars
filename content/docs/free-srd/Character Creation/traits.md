# Traits

Traits are descriptors of your character. They represent a part of their personality or physique. Traits are selected at level 1 and cannot be selected multiple times.

Some traits are followed by labels — written in [brackets] — depending on the setting and set of character features being used. A character cannot have more than one trait with the same label.
