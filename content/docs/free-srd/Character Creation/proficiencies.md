## Proficiencies

Proficiencies are things for which your character has recieved training or otherwise become particularly skilled at. Most are related to the use of items. Certain actions cannot be attempted at all without the appropriate tool/item and proficiency.

Sometimes an additional selection needs to be made, such as a type of weapon or armor. This selection is made at the time of selecting the proficiency and is usually written in [brackets] beside the proficiency name.

If a proficiency has requirements that must be met before it can be selected, they are written in italics.
