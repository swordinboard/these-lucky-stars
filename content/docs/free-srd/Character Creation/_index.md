## Character Creation

## Character Archetypes

Unlike many systems use a class system to define different character roles and determine special abilities, These Lucky Stars is classless and leaves full creative power to the players. Even so, to help hone in on your character it is often helpful to define a character by archetype. Choose a short description that presents an overview of the character. Some examples: “Sneaky Pirate,” “Stalwart Defender,” “Lucky Pilot,” “Fire Mage,” “Tired Librarian,” “Gibbering Warrior,” “Reluctant Manager,” "Retiring Officer." This title will not be referenced otherwise during character creation or level up, but it will provide the party and GM with a general sense of your character. As you play and level up, this archetype may change. When in doubt, look to your selected character features for inspiration.

## Character Features

There are three types of character features: traits, proficiencies, and abilities.

**Traits** are descriptors of your character. They represent a part of their personality or physique. Traits are selected at level 1 and cannot be selected multiple times.
Some traits are followed by labels -written in [brackets]- depending on the setting and set of character features being used. A character cannot have more than one trait with the same label.

**Proficiencies** are things your character is particularly skilled with, most are related to the use of items and/or provide a passive bonus. Some can be selected multiple times. Some actions cannot be attempted without the appropriate toolkit and/or proficiency. Sometimes an additional selection needs to be made, such as a type of weapon or armor. This selection is made at the time of selecting the proficiency and is written in [brackets].

**Abilities** are special actions your character can take. Abilities have the most variance in usage and effects. Some abilities provide new actions, others modify existing actions, and some provide passive bonuses. Some abilities can be taken multiple times, improving upon the original effect or number of uses.

## Starting at Level 1

- Step 1: Begin with determining and assigning your [attributes](docs/free-srd/attributes).
- Step 2: Use your attributes to calculate your remaining [stats](docs/free-srd/stats).
- Step 3: Choose your first level character features. Each character starts at level one with:
- One Racial Trait
- Two additional Traits
- Two Proficiencies
- One Ability

## Leveling Up

As characters increase in level they gain access to new features and increases to attributes.

> - At every level after first a character gains their choice of one ability or proficiency.
> - On every even numbered level, a character also gains one attribute point to assign as they like. (Maximum attribute value is 7 before modifiers.)

While there is no max level in this system and a GM may alter the power-scale of their setting/game in any way they like, typically the following level spread tends to give access to an appropriate number of features and bonuses.
- Average NPC or low level PC: Levels 3-5.
- Trained professionals: Levels 5-7
- Seasoned veterans and adventurers: Levels 8-12
- Heroic characters and legends: Level 12+
