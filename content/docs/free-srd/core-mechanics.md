## Key Terms

**Game Master (GM)** – The person running the game. Responsible for creating the setting, describing scenarios, determining rolls and target numbers, lots of things.

**Player** – A person playing a character within the game other than the GM. Responsible for maintaining their sheet and stats.

**Party** – The players as a group. Responsible for working together, or not. Depends.

**Table** – The players and the GM as a group. Responsible for recognizing modifiers, maintaining honesty, fair play, and a good time.

**Modifiers** — Any additional value that alters another value. A *bonus* is a positive modifier. A *penalty* is a negative modifier. If something states a bonus and the value is negative, the bonus is 0. If something states a penalty and the value is positive, the penalty is 0. If something states a modifier it can use a bonus or a penalty.

## Decision Rolls

In most situations when determining the success or failure of an action the following mechanic will be used:

**2d6 + STAT + MODIFIERS VS. TARGET NUMBER**

The d6 used during such rolls, regardless of how many, are refered to as the **Decision Dice.**

### Target Numbers

The target number lands on a scale that is based on the difficulty of the action being attempted. Many tasks have guidelines associated with them to help the Game Master best determine where on the scale a given target should begin, particularly during combat. Otherwise, it is up to the best judgment of the GM to determine the difficulty and target number.

**Certain limitations should be noted:**

The standard decision dice create a small probability curve, averaging at 7.

The standard maximum roll without any modifiers on a normal 2d6 decision roll is a 12, with less than a 3% chance.
similarly, the minimum is 2.

Any modifiers to the roll move the curve and change the min/max values.
A simple +1 to that roll increases the odds of getting 12 or higher to almost 9%.
Meanwhile, the odds of getting an 8 or higher on the same roll is 41% without any modifiers and jumps to 58% with a +1.

This curve and scaling increase rewards choices during character creation/level up and makes low level modifiers the most volatile, especially when paired with Advantage/Disadvantage and Luck.

### Difficulty Scale

| Description        | Target Number   |
|--------------------|-----------------|
|         ↑          | 22+             |
| "Impossible" Task  | 20              |
| Strenuous Task     | 18              |
|         ↓          | 16              |
|         ↓          | 14              |
| Challenging Task   | 12              |
|         ↓          | 10              |
|         ↓          | 8               |
| Simple Task        | 6               |
|         ↓          | 4               |
|                    | 2               |

#### Max Rolls

It should be noted that for low level characters (levels 1-5), most tasks in the Strenuous range are unachievable or on the < 10% change range depending on an individuals attribute scores. While this may improve at mid and higher levels, the hard cap of 12 (high end of 2d6) for an individual with a 0 attribute and no other modifiers should be kept in mind, and unskilled or unprepared characters at all levels will often face such a cap.

#### "Impossible" Tasks

The "Impossible" task description is used to describe any task that would be narratively impossible to achieve normally. For example: Lifting a train car over one's head, running on a cloud, convincing a King to invade his closest ally unprovoked, knowing the exact number of grains of sand in a large jar at a glance. These things cannot - or should not - normally be attempted as there is no way one would reasonably be able to succeed. It is up to the GM to decide whether to allow something to be attempted if the difficulty should begin at or above "Impossible." A target that reaches this description due to adjustments, abilities, or other modifications to the target value, is not considered an "Impossible" task.

### Success and Failure

{{% hint note %}}
**Short Version:**
Success = Higher than or equal to target.
{{% /hint %}}

When the result of a roll has been determined and is equal to or higher than the target, the action is a success, the GM describes what has occurred, and play continues.

When the result is lower than the target the action is unsuccessful, the GM describes what has occurred, and play continues

All GMs have their own style. Some use the situation itself to guage the results of the roll, others uses how far from the target the roll is to determine how dramatic the success or failure is. Whatever the case, consistency is key.

## Advantage and Disadvantage

{{% hint note %}}
**Short Version:**
Alter decision dice at GM's discresion:
Advantage = 3d6
Disadvantage = 1d6
{{% /hint %}}

Some situations require a bit of dramatic effect to properly be portrayed by the dice. The GM may reward advantage or disadvantage in any such situation at thwir discresion, drastically altering the decision dice available.

**Advantage** adds one d6 to the decision dice for a total of 3d6. Advantage may be rewarded when characters have activaly worked to be particularly prepared for a situation, propose creative solutions, have clearly outmatched an opponent, or have created some other form of favorable situation that goes beyond the normal alteration of the target number or bonuses provided.

**Disadvantage** removes one d6 from the decision dice for a total of 1d6. Disadvantage may be given when the players characters are significantly unprepared, are heavily outmatched or outnumbered, or are facing multiple unfavorabke conditions rhat go bwyond the normal alteratiob of the target nunber or bonuses provided.

Advantage/disadvantage should only be used when the narrative and situaution call for a dramatic effect or drastic offset at the discression of the GM, and usually only stick around for a roll or two. The effects do not stack, as normal sitiations or those that face both at once should cancel out to the neutral 2d6.

## General Rules of Play

### Contested Rolls

Occasionally, characters may face a situation requiring a contested roll. Each character simply rolls their decision dice and adds their applicable modifiers, with the win going to the highest roller.

### Resolving a Tie

A tie with a target number counts as a success. If a tie occures during a contested roll, the decision dice are rerolled until a winner is determined.

### The Rounding Rule

Anytime you are faced with a fraction in the end result of a roll or series of rolls, round down. This only happens at the end, not in the middle of calculations.

{{% hint tip %}}
**Example:**
The most forthcoming example of this is when calculating Stress and Vitality, which require two values to be halved and added together:

- If those values are 3 and 1, they become 1.5 and 0.5, and are added together to become 2.
- If those values are 3 and 2, they become 1.5 and 1, and are added up to become 2.5, which is then rounded down to 2.

## Secondary Mechanics

### Supply Rolls

Supply rolls or supply dice are used to track inventory and conditions with a level of randomness to them. 
Many pieces of equipment, particularly kits, do not have a set number of uses as different applications will require a different amounts of supplies to complete. To simulate this the number of uses is described by a die size. Details on when supply rolls are performed and if/how an item can be resupplied is provided in its description.

When using equipment that requires a supply roll to complete/attempt an action, roll the die listed. If the result is 3 or lower, the die size is lowered a size. Each roll is handled individually after the action is complete. Empty items cannot be used if a supply roll is rewuired, but can still be used in situations when supply rolls are not needed. This is particularly common with kits, where sometimes the tools are needed without using any of the consumables.

**Supplies die sizes/order: D12, D10, D8, D6, D4, Empty.**

### D100 or Percentage

In situations where a decision roll cannot be made, a supply roll does not apply, and normal means of tracking a number just doesn't fit, the situation will likely be resolved with some form of D100 roll or percentage tracker. These rules are few, the most common one involves tracking ammunition.
