# Character Attributes

Attributes act as your primary stat block, the building blocks of your character that act as a base for their other stats. They are divided into two categories: physical attributes and mental attributes.

For ease of reference attributes are often written as two numbers, the temporary value after modifiers and the base value before modifiers.

Attribute checks are used for any action that does not directly have another stat affecting it. The attribute used is determined by the GM, based on the player's description of their action.

## Two Ways to Determine Attributes

### Roll Your Attributes - The Standard

Roll 2d4, then subtract the lower result from the higher result. Repeat this process until you have a total of 8 values, one to be assigned to each attribute.

**Attribute = |1d4-1d4|**

{{% hint tip %}}
**Example:** If I roll a 2 and a 4, I subtract 4-2, to get a value of 2.
{{% /hint %}}

### Attribute Pool
Using the rolling method above, each player rolls 8 attribute values and adds them to a pool for the entire party. The party then distributes the pool of attribute values across all characters as they see fit. It should be noted that this gives the party the opportunity to adapt the Luck stat however they like.

## Attribute Values

**Maximum** attribute value without modifiers is equal to character level +2.

There is no **minimum** atteibute value.

{{% hint tip %}}
**Example:** A level 2 character has a maximum attribute value of 4 before applying modifiers.
{{% /hint %}}

**Poor Attributes:** A poor attribute is any attribute with a value less than 0. Poor attributes can lead to the crippled or unconscious conditions.

A character with two or more poor physical attributes is crippled until they no longer have two or more poor physical attributes.

A character with two or more poor mental attributes falls unconscious until they no longer have two or more poor mental attributes.

**Null Attributes:**  Some creatures have null [-N-] attributes. Null attributes are effectively 0, however cannot be raised or lowered.
