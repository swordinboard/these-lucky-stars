# OH NO THOUGHTS of Rewriting

{{% hint important %}}
**Primary Changes:**
Moving from 1d20 to **2d6** as the primary decision mechanic. The math benefits player choices and offers better odds early in leveled play. This does result in a change to your attribute values, which I go over how to adapt below.

Second Major change is to Luck, giving it more swing and making it a gamble rather than a guarantee. Makes it the more of the tool I intended it to be rather than the basically necessary addition to each choice.

# Base Mechanic

To determine success or failure of an action, the following mechanic is used:

**2D6 + MODIFIERS VS. TARGET NUMBER**

## Attribute Values

With the 2d6 system, attribute values will be calculated a little differently: value = |1d4-1d4| including zeros. All players can adapt their original attribute values (before any bonus points added from leveling up) using this [Attribute Convertion Tool](/attributeconverter.html) that I made. Just plug in your base array, and it will spit out the equivalent array under new system. Then add back in any changes from leveling that you had, if any.

## Determining the Target Number

The target number lands on a scale as before, but with a shift in numbers.

## Updated 2d6 Difficulty Scale

| Description        | Target Number   |
|--------------------|-----------------|
|         ↑          | 22+             |
| "Impossible" Task  | 20              |
| Strenuous Task     | 18              |
|         ↓          | 16              |
|         ↓          | 14              |
| Challenging Task   | 12              |
|         ↓          | 10              |
|         ↓          | 8               |
| Simple Task        | 6               |
|         ↓          | 4               |
|                    | 2               |

Movement from advantage and disadvantage, impossible tasks, and other functions relating to the scale, remain the same.

## Success and Failure

{{% hint info %}}
**Short Version:** Unchanged:
Success = Higher than or equal to target.
{{% /hint %}}

When the total result of a roll has been determined and is equal to or higher than the target, the action is a success, the GM describes what has occurred, and play continues.

When the result is lower than the target the action is unsuccessful, the GM describes what has occurred, and play continues.

## Contested Rolls

{{% hint info %}}
**Short Version:** Unchanged:
Result vs Result, ties roll without modifiers until decided.
{{% /hint %}}

Occasionally, characters may face a situation requiring a contested roll. Each character simply rolls their 2d6 and adds their applicable modifiers, with the win going to the highest roller.

*A tie in a contested roll is rerolled without any modifiers, until a winner is determined.*

## Group Rolls

{{% hint info %}}
**Short Version:**
Only when applicable:
Group result = result +1 per ally involved
{{% /hint %}}

When two or more characters are involved in an action a group roll can be used. Group rolls can also be applied to contested rolls. The GM decides when group rolls can apply. In most cases, only two characters can attempt an action together effectively.

**Group rolls: Participating ally adds +1 to result.**

# Supply Rolls

{{% hint info %}}
**Short:** Unchanged:
When prompted roll the current supply die:
D12, D10, D8, D6,or D4. results of three or less lower the die size by one until empty.
{{% /hint %}}

Supply rolls or supply dice are used to track inventory and conditions with a level of randomness to them. 
Many pieces of equipment, particularly kits, do not have a set number of uses. Different applications will require different amounts of supplies to complete. To simulate this the number of uses is described by a die size. Details on when supply rolls are performed and if/how an item can be resupplied is provided in its description.

When using equipment that requires a supply roll to complete/attempt an action, roll the die listed. If the result is 3 or lower, the die size is lowered a size until empty.

Supplies die sizes/order: D12, D10, D8, D6, D4, Empty.

# Luck

{{% hint info %}}
**Short Version:** 
*Evens* on Luck dice add *bonus* normally.
*Odds* do not, and instead cause a flat -2 penalty to the roll.*
{{% /hint %}}

Luck can still be used to add a 1d4 to any 2d6 action/decision roll. However, when determing results even numbers on the Luck die are added in normaly, while odd numbers cause a flat -2 penalty to the roll instead of being added in.
