# Introduction

This began as a simple "just beat 15" ruleset with six attributes a luck stat and no frill, at all. Wilth a wee sprinkle of OCD or whatever's going on upstair, we are here now. (One day, I will make that simple system avaible here.)

This is intended to be a core system to adapted to any setting and situation.

While this is being written content may come and go from the site. Updates to the rules doc will be posted on discord and a copy will always be kept there. My hope is that the core rules outside character creation are solid enough to drop here for easier referenceing and searching. Hopefully these only need minor tweaks if anything, or at most rewording and writing style or format changes.

Hope this helps,
-Anthony DiRuzza

# Some Key Terms

**Game Master (GM)** – The person running the game. Responsible for creating the setting, describing scenarios, determining rolls and target numbers, lots of things.

**Player** – A person playing a character within the game other than the GM. Responsible for maintaining their sheet and stats.

**Party** – The players as a group. Responsible for working together, or not. Depends.

**Table** – The players and the GM as a group. Responsible for recognizing modifiers, maintaining honesty, fair play, and a good time.

---

**Modifiers** — Any additional value that alters another value. A *bonus* is a positive modifier. A *penalty* is a negative modifier. If something states a bonus and the value is negative, the bonus is 0. If something states a penalty and the value is positive, the penalty is 0. If something states a modifier it can use a bonus or a penalty.

**Target Number** — A value used to describe the difficulty of attempting an action. You must meet or exceed this value to succeed.

# Base Mechanic

In most situations when determining success and failure some form of the following mechanic will be used:

**D20 + STAT + MODIFIERS VS. TARGET NUMBER**

## Determining the Target Number

The target number lands on a scale that is based on the difficulty of the action being attempted. Many tasks have guidelines associated with them to help the Game Master best determine where on the scale a given target should land, particularly during combat. Otherwise, it is up to the best judgment of the GM to determine the difficulty and target number.

## Difficulty Scale

| Difficulty Description | Target Number (Steps) |
|------------------------|----------------------|
| "Impossible" Task      | 39+                  |
|                        | 36                   |
|                        | 33                   |
| Strenuous Task         | 30                   |
|                        | 27                   |
|                        | 24                   |
| Challenging Task       | 21                   |
|                        | 18                   |
|                        | 15                   |
| Simple Task            | 12                   |
|                        | 9                    |
|                        | 6                    |
|                        | 3                    |

With a little practice, use of this scale becomes intuitive. It may help the GM to have it written or printed in front of them so they may quickly move a marker along it during situations with many modifiers such as combat.

Situational advantages/disadvantages move the target up or down the scale. For example, using inappropriate tools for a task - such as using a screwdriver as a hammer - results in the target becoming more difficult and moving up the scale.

All attack and stealth rolls start at 15. Advantages to the defender move the target up the scale, while advantages to the attacker move the target down the scale.

### "Impossible" Tasks

The "Impossible" task description is used to describe any task that would be impossible to achieve normally. For example: Lifting a train car over one's head, running on a cloud, convincing a King to invade his closest ally unprovoked, knowing the exact number of grains of sand in a large jar at a glance. These things cannot - or should not - normally be attempted as there is no way one would reasonably be able to succeed. It is up to the GM to decide whether to allow something to be attempted if the difficulty should begin at or above "Impossible." A target that reaches these target steps due to adjustments from advantages, disadvantages, abilities, or other modifications to the target value, is not considered an "Impossible" task.

## Success and Failure

When the result of a roll has been determined and is equal to or higher than the target, the action is a success, the GM describes what has occurred, and play continues.

When the result is lower than the target the action is unsuccessful, the GM describes what has occurred, and play continues.

Describing these actions can take practice. Each GM has their own level of serious realism or nonsensical fun that they wish to inspire, and these descriptions are excellent places to do so. Leaning into the numbers to generate variety helps keep the table lively. This way, the further away from the target number the result is the more dramatic the result. A result much higher than the target may be described as completed with ease or flare, and one much lower may be described as failing dramatically or as a struggle to attempt. Those close to the target may be described as just barely missing the mark or succeeding just in time.

**Important:** In the case of a tie the win goes to the roller. Think of the target number as the minimum number needed to succeed. Ties during a contested roll are rerolled.

## Contested Rolls

Occasionally, characters may face a situation requiring a contested roll. Each character simply rolls a D20 and adds their applicable modifiers, with the win going to the highest roller of the characters or groups involved.

If a group of two or more characters are involved in a contested roll the opposing groups use the highest roll of their allies +2 for each additional ally involved in the action.

**Example:** Take two characters attempting to restrain a third:
- Allied pair roll 15 and 7, which becomes 15+2=17
- Resisting combatant rolls a 16

In this case the resisting character would be restrained even though his roll was the highest out of the three. Teamwork rewards the pair, and they win the roll.

# Supply Rolls <!-- interrupted in this section, incomplete -->

Supply rolls or supply dice are used to track inventory and conditions with a level of randomness to them. 
Many pieces of equipment, particularly kits, do not have a set number of uses. Different applications will require different amounts of supplies to complete. To simulate this the number of uses is described by a die size. Details on when supply rolls are performed and if/how an item can be resupplied is provided in its description.

When using equipment that requires a supply roll to complete/attempt an action, roll the die listed. If the result is 3 or lower, the die size is lowered a size until empty.

Supplies die sizes/order: D12, D10, D8, D6, D4, Empty.

# The Rounding Rule

Anytime you are faced with a fraction in the end result of a roll or series of rolls, round down. This only happens at the end, not in the middle of calculations. The most forthcoming example of this is when calculating Stress and Vitality, which require two values to be halved and added together:

- If those values are 3 and 1, they become 1.5 and 0.5, and are added together to become 2.
- If those values are 3 and 2, they become 1.5 and 1, and are added up to become 2.5, which is then rounded down to 2.
