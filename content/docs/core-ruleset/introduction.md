# Introduction

This began as a simple "just beat 15" ruleset with six attributes a luck stat and no frill, at all. Wilth a wee sprinkle of OCD or whatever's going on upstairs, we arehave evoleved to a more robust ruleset with open character development. (One day, I will make that simple system avaible here.)

This is intended to be a core system to adapted to any setting and situation.

While this is being written content may come and go from the site. 
for official playtestwrs, updates to the setting doc will be posted on discord and a copy will always be kept there.

Hope this helps,
-Anthony

# Key Terms

**Game Master (GM)** – The person running the game. Responsible for creating the setting, describing scenarios, determining rolls and target numbers, lots of things.

**Player** – A person playing a character within the game other than the GM. Responsible for maintaining their sheet and stats.

**Party** – The players as a group. Responsible for working together, or not. Depends.

**Table** – The players and the GM as a group. Responsible for recognizing modifiers, maintaining honesty, fair play, and a good time.

{{% hint important %}}
**Modifiers** — Any additional value that alters another value. A *bonus* is a positive modifier. A *penalty* is a negative modifier. If something states a bonus and the value is negative, the bonus is 0. If something states a penalty and the value is positive, the penalty is 0. If something states a modifier it can use a bonus or a penalty.

# Decision Rolls

In most situations when determining the success or failure of an action the following mechanic will be used:

**2d6 + STAT + MODIFIERS VS. TARGET NUMBER**

The d6 used during such rolls are refered to as **Decision Dice.**

## Determining the Target Number

The target number lands on a scale that is based on the difficulty of the action being attempted. Many tasks have guidelines associated with them to help the Game Master best determine where on the scale a given target should begin, particularly during combat. Otherwise, it is up to the best judgment of the GM to determine the difficulty and target number.

## Difficulty Scale

| Description        | Target Number   |
|--------------------|-----------------|
|         ↑          | 22+             |
| "Impossible" Task  | 20              |
| Strenuous Task     | 18              |
|         ↓          | 16              |
|         ↓          | 14              |
| Challenging Task   | 12              |
|         ↓          | 10              |
|         ↓          | 8               |
| Simple Task        | 6               |
|         ↓          | 4               |
|                    | 2               |

### "Impossible" Tasks

The "Impossible" task description is used to describe any task that would be impossible to achieve normally. For example: Lifting a train car over one's head, running on a cloud, convincing a King to invade his closest ally unprovoked, knowing the exact number of grains of sand in a large jar at a glance. These things cannot - or should not - normally be attempted as there is no way one would reasonably be able to succeed. It is up to the GM to decide whether to allow something to be attempted if the difficulty should begin at or above "Impossible." A target that reaches these target steps due to adjustments from advantages, disadvantages, abilities, or other modifications to the target value, is not considered an "Impossible" task.

## Success and Failure

{{% hint note %}}
**Short Version:**
Success = Higher than or equal to target.
{{% /hint %}}

When the result of a roll has been determined and is equal to or higher than the target, the action is a success, the GM describes what has occurred, and play continues.

When the result is lower than the target the action is unsuccessful, the GM describes what has occurred, and play continues

<!-- Change this section to reflect shortened docsite style -->
Describing these actions can take practice. Each GM has their own level of serious realism or nonsensical fun that they wish to inspire, and these descriptions are excellent places to do so. Leaning into the numbers to generate variety helps keep the table lively. This way, the further away from the target number the result is the more dramatic the result. A result much higher than the target may be described as completed with ease or flare, and one much lower may be described as failing dramatically or as a struggle to attempt. Those close to the target may be described as just barely missing the mark or succeeding just in time.

# General Rules of Play

## Contested Rolls

Occasionally, characters may face a situation requiring a contested roll. Each character simply rolls their 2D6 and adds their applicable modifiers, with the win going to the highest roller of the characters or groups involved.

{{% hint tip %}}
**Example:**
Take two characters attempting to restrain a third:
- Allied pair roll 15 and 7, which becomes 15+2=17
- Resisting combatant rolls a 16
In this case the resisting character would be restrained even though his roll was the highest out of the three. Teamwork rewards the pair, and they win the roll.

## Group Rolls

{{% hint note %}}
**Short Version:**
Only when applicable:
Group result = Highest roll involved
{{% /hint %}}

When two or more allied characters are involved in the same action a group roll may be used. Group rolls use the highest result of the allies involved.  Group rolls can be applied to contested rolls. Because not all situations allow for two characters to take an action or offer aid ina  meaningful way, the GM decides when group rolls can apply. In most cases, only two characters can attempt an action together effectively.

## Resolving a Tied Result

A tie with a target number counts as a success. If a tie occures during a contested roll, the decision dice (2D6) are rerolled until a winner is determined.

## The Rounding Rule

Anytime you are faced with a fraction in the end result of a roll or series of rolls, round down. This only happens at the end, not in the middle of calculations.

{{% hint tip %}}
**Example:**
The most forthcoming example of this is when calculating Stress and Vitality, which require two values to be halved and added together:

- If those values are 3 and 1, they become 1.5 and 0.5, and are added together to become 2.
- If those values are 3 and 2, they become 1.5 and 1, and are added up to become 2.5, which is then rounded down to 2.

# Secondary Mechanics

## Supply Rolls

Supply rolls or supply dice are used to track inventory and conditions with a level of randomness to them. 
Many pieces of equipment, particularly kits, do not have a set number of uses as different applications will require a different amounts of supplies to complete. To simulate this the number of uses is described by a die size. Details on when supply rolls are performed and if/how an item can be resupplied is provided in its description.

When using equipment that requires a supply roll to complete/attempt an action, roll the die listed. If the result is 3 or lower, the die size is lowered a size. Each roll is handled individually after the action is complete. Empty items cannot be used if a supply roll is rewuired, but can still be used in situations when supply rolls are not needed. This is particularly common with kits, where sometimes the tools are needed without using any of the consumables.

**Supplies die sizes/order: D12, D10, D8, D6, D4, Empty.**

## D100 or Percentage

In situations where a 2D6 decision roll cannot be made, a supply roll does not apply, and normal means of tracking a number just doesn't fit, the situation will likely be resolved with some form of D100 roll or percentage tracker. These rules are few, the most common one involves tracking ammunition.
