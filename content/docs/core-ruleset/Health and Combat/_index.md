# Health

Combat in These Lucky Stars uses a unique health system. The first layer, Defense, represents how well a character defends against attacks, both in avoiding then and bracing against them. The second layer, Vitality, represents how much of a beating or how many injuries a character can withstand before they are incapacitated. During combat a character may also withstand wounds and conditions which, while related, have their own set of effects that change gameplay and demand attention to resolve.
