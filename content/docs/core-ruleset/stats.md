# Character Stats

These stats are derived from Attributes. Most of them are combat focused, but are important for any character nonetheless. All of them can be affected by additional modifiers from a range of effects, character features, and items. Unless otherwise noted stats can be negative, providing a penalty rather than a bonus. Some stats act as a pool of points, others act as modifiers for certain rolls. They are listed here in a similar order to how they appear on the basic character sheet.

## Combat & Action Stats

### Initiative
**= AGI + DEX + INS**

How swiftly a character reacts to a surprise situation, initiative determines the order in which turns will be taken during combat. Initiative is determined at the beginning of combat, characters who have not yet had their first turn are considered out of combat and are vulnerable to surprise attacks. See the section on Combat for more details.

### Action Points
**= 4 (Base)**

Action Points (AP) are spent during combat to take actions. The more complicated or the more time consuming an action is, the more AP the action uses. All characters start with 4 AP. See Actions in Combat for more on Action Points.

### Speed (______)
**= 20 + 5 per +1 AGI Bonus or Flat -5 if AGI Penalty**

Speed is a summary of the normal movement speed of a character, conveniently rounded to 5ft spaces. The speed equation provided is used to describe a character or creature's primary mode of travel (in most cases it is Speed(ground) for those that live on land).

The descriptor of the speed determines what type of movement or terrain the speed applies to:

**-Ground** is the standard, for walking and running upon the ground. Most characters have a ground speed.
**-Climb** refers to how fast one climbs vertical surfaces.
**-Swim** refers to how fast one moves through water.
**-Fly** refers to how fast one moves through the air. A fly speed also has maneuverability, (High(0), Medium(+2), or Low(+4)) that determines how many spaces are required for a character to make a 90° turn. To determine how many spaces are required, add the corresponding maneuverability number to the character's size value (See Size Chart). The arc is then traced forward and to the side that many spaces. The minimum number of spaces is 1.

## Health & Defense Stats

### Defense
**= AGI Bonus + FORT Bonus (Min 1)**

Defense (DEF) is a measurement of how well a character can react to a situation to avoid dangers. When a successful attack is made, damage is dealt to the defender's DEF. Once a character's DEF reaches 0, they lose one point of Vitality, their DEF is reset, and the process repeats until no damage remains to be dealt. DEF is reset anytime Vitality loss is dealt, or when a character is considered safe from combat (GM discretion, usually when combat ends or the character gains total cover or is hidden from all opponents). See Combat for more details on DEF, VIT, and wounds.

{{% hint success %}}
**Example of Defense Reset:** An in-world example of DEF resetting may be described as when a character readies themselves or regains their composure after receiving or dodging blows.

### Vitality
**= ½ Level + ½ Max FORT (Total Rounded Down, Min 1)**

Vitality represents a character's overall health and endurance of ailments. The more Vitality a character has, the more they can carry on through illness and wounds before succumbing to them. In combat, Vitality (VIT) represents the number of blows a character can take before being incapacitated. Taking multiple points of VIT damage from a single attack also causes the character to receive a wound or condition. When a character's VIT reaches 0 the attacker (or GM if an effect) must choose the final blow to be lethal or non-lethal. If they choose lethal, the character gains the dying condition, if nonlethal the character is left unconscious. 1 VIT is recovered with a week of rest. Max VIT is affected by changes to a character's FORT.

### Wounds and Conditions

A **wound** is an injury, usually brought on by an attack or other damaging effect. Many wounds have conditions associated with them. Wounds may be caused by:

- When a character takes two or more VIT damage from a single attack
- Loss of a character's final VIT point
- Special effects such as abilities and environmental effects.

A **condition** is part of a broad category of effects that can also come from a variety of sources, including attacks, wounds, abilities, stress, VIT loss, and environment.

### Stress Threshold
**= ½ Level + ½ WILL (Total Rounded Down, Min 1)**

Your character's Stress Threshold represents the amount of stress they can endure before it takes a toll on their actions. Stress can be gained from a variety of sources such as abilities, conditions, and failed rolls. When a character's stress level reaches their threshold, they gain the stressed condition. Most stress is reset after a rest unless specified otherwise. Stress caused by wounds can only be reset when the wound is healed. Stress Threshold is affected by changes to ones WILL.

## Other Stats

### Luck
**= 3 + Party Attribute Modifiers (Min 1)**

Luck points can be used to add 1d4 to any decision roll made by your character (only 1d4 per decision roll). Luck points replenish at the beginning of each session, so be sure to use them up each session. Character features or other effects may allow luck to be used in additional ways. Temporary mods/damage to attributes does not affect total Luck. Your total Luck is dependent on your party. To calculate the number of Luck points your character has during character creation, begin with 3 points and use the table to determine any modifiers.

Each player works their way down the table and compares their attributes to the rest of the party. If the statement in the left column is true about your character adjust your Luck by the amount corresponding to that statement. Each character may be affected my multiple Luck adjustments, or none at all. If a tie is presented by any number of characters, those characters are all effected by the adjustment.

| Of the party, your character has the… | Luck = 3… |
|--------------------------------------|-----------|
| Highest attribute total              | -1        |
| Lowest attribute total               | +1        |
| Lowest physical attribute total      | +1        |
| Lowest mental attribute total        | +1        |

### Grapple
**= STR + AGI**

Used when engaging in a grapple with an opponent in the form of a contested D20 roll. Though rare, grappling with multiple opponents or allies is possible and follows the same rules as other contested rolls. See Special Attacks in the Combat section for more details.

### Stealth

Like many other rolls, Stealth checks are made using different attributes based on the action being taken. Modifiers to stealth are common from armor and character features.

### Attack
**= STR or DEX**

The attribute used while making an attack (ATK) varies depending on the type of weapon being used and the type of attack being made. As such, attack values are located in the weapons block on the character sheet. In most cases, melee attacks will use STR while ranged attacks will use DEX.

## Blank Boxes

The character sheet has a pair of blank boxes to add common modifiers based on game/character. It may be helpful to have a reference for actions such as pilot, drive, charge, disarm, or intimidate.
