You can install These Lucky Stars as an app on your device for quick access and partial offline use.

Once installed, the app will appear on your home screen or app launcher like any other app. *Pages you've visited will be available offline* — handy for sessions without reliable internet. You can also open directly to the character sheet via a hold/right click shortcut on the app icon.
