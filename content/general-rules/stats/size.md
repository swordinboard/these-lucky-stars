# Size

Size is designed to be relative to the party and scale of the world being played in. In most cases, the party will be of average human height and be working in a world designed for that.

The size scale works in half steps. This means creatures that are ½ the general height of the party's average are a size smaller, and those that are 2x the average are a size larger. Final interpretation is up to the GM and is not meant to be taken to exact measurements from the average. If the average party is 5ft 6in, playing in a world designed for humans, a small creature may simply be described as being under 3ft, and a large one over 10ft. Each size has a number associated with it describing how far up or down the scale it is from average party height. The base size for the majority of the party should be Medium/0.

Attacks and damage are dependent on comparable size. In short, smaller characters are harder to hit, and larger characters hit harder. Size also influences physical attributes. Larger and smaller characters are affected by modifiers as shown on the Character Size Chart.
