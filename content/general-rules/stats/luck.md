# Luck = 5 + Party Attribute Modifiers (Min 1)

Luck points can be used to add 1d4 to any d20 roll. Luck points replenish with a rest. Character features or other effects may allow luck to be used in additional ways. Temporary mods/damage to attributes does not affect total Luck. Your total Luck is dependent on your party. To calculate the number of Luck points your character has during character creation, begin with 5 points and use the table to determine any modifiers. Each player works their way down the table and compares their attributes to the rest of the party. If the statement in the left column is true about your character adjust your Luck by the amount corresponding to that statement. Each character may be affected my multiple Luck adjustments, or none at all. If a tie is presented by any number of characters, those characters are all effected by the adjustment.
