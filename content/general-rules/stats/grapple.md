# Grapple = STR + AGI

Engaging in a grapple uses contested grapple checks for most action. Though rare, grappling with multiple opponents or allies is possible and follows the same rules as other contested rolls.

**Grapple —** Attempting to begin a grapple is a special attack that costs 2 AP and occurs when one or more characters attempt to grab hold of and restrain another character. Only the character or group of characters that is in control of the grapple can take actions other than attempting to gain control.

To initiate a grapple simply make a contested grapple check against your opponent. The winner of the contested roll decides whether to engage in the grapple or end it immediately. If they choose to engage, they gain control of the grapple and can take actions within the grapple normally in initiative. Any character that is not in control of the grapple is considered pinned and must attempt to gain control at the beginning of their turn for 1 AP. If they are unsuccessful, they remain pinned and cannot take any other actions.

If another character wishes to enter in an active grapple, they must spend 2 AP to do so as if initiating. Such characters may resist or aid other actions, following the same rules as contested rolls with multiple combatants.

### Actions in a Grapple

**In Control —** Move up to 10ft in any direction (3 AP), Attack (only if unarmed or while using a light weapon) (3 AP), End Grapple (1 AP), Toss opponent up to 10ft with successful STR roll (3 AP)

**Pinned —** Gain control (3AP) by winning a contested grapple check. If there are multiple opponents in the grapple and you are successful choose one to consider pinned, the rest will be considered aiding.

**Aiding —** Attempt to gain control as if pinned, or leave the grapple for 3 AP.
