Speed is a measurement of the normal walking or running speed of a character, conveniently rounded to 5ft spaces. The speed equation provided is used to describe a character or creature's primary mode of travel (in most cases it is Speed(ground) for those that live on land).

The descriptor of the speed determines what type of movement or terrain the speed applies to:
– **Ground** is the standard, for walking and running upon the ground. Most characters have a ground speed.
– **Climb** refers to how fast one climbs vertical surfaces.
– **Swim** refers to how fast one moves through water.
– **Fly** refers to how fast one moves through the air. A fly speed also has maneuverability, (High(0), Medium(+2), or Low(+4)) that determines how many spaces are required for a character to make a 90° turn. To determine how many spaces are required, add the corresponding maneuverability number to the character's size. The arc is then traced forward and to the side that many spaces. The minimum number of spaces is 1.
