# Attack = STR or DEX

The attribute used while making an attack (ATK) varies depending on the type of weapon being used and the type of attack being made. As such, attack values are located in the weapons block on the character sheet.
In most cases, melee attacks will use STR while ranged attacks will use DEX.
