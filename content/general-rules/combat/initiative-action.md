# Initiative Order

[Initiative](initiative) determines the order in which characters take their turn. When combat begins, all combatants are placed in order of initiative, from highest to lowest. The character with the highest initiative goes first.

In the case of a tie in initiative order between opponents (usually player characters vs nonplayer characters) the group that initiated combat goes first. In the case of a tie between allies, the order is decided between their respective players and may change from round to round as they see fit. If another sort of tie is presented somehow, it can be resolved with a coin flip.

# Taking Action

Like in many systems, each set of turns is described as a round.

During each character's turn they spend [Actions Points](action-Points) (AP) to perform an action.

All characters have four AP to spend per round. A character's AP regenerate at the beginning of their turn. Some character features or other effects may grant bonus AP.

The more time or involvement an action takes to perform, the more AP it uses.

Simple tasks require only one AP to perform. I.e. picking an item up, drinking a potion already in one's hand, drawing a non-concealed weapon, stepping to an adjacent space, or opening a door.

Tasks that require some degree of focus or are more time-consuming require two AP. I.e. making an attack, moving up to your speed, or putting items into a backpack.

Tasks that require a character's full attention, are more complex than similar tasks, and/or a lot of time to perform require three or more AP. I.e. attempting to safely disable a trap or attempting to intimidate opponents while breaking through a door.

# Actions in Combat

Actions in combat consume Action Points (AP) which replenish at the beginning of a character's turn. Some complex actions can be started in one turn and finished in another, but most must consume all the required AP in one single turn.

## Aggressive Actions

**Standard Attack — 2 AP —** Once per turn you may attempt a basic melee or ranged attack with any weapon or while unarmed.

**Move — 2AP —** During your turn you can move up to your move speed for 2 AP as an aggressive action. This action can be taken multiple times.

**Attack of Opportunity (AOO) — 1 AP —** Once per round during another character's turn, you may make an attack of opportunity against any character within your reach that takes an aggressive action as long as you are wielding a melee weapon and have acted in combat. Normally, an AOO cannot be made while unarmed.

**Disarm — 3 AP —** As a special attack, you may attempt to disarm your opponent with a melee weapon that you are proficient with. Make a standard attack roll, if successful you and your opponent make contested STR rolls. Success causes your opponent to drop their weapon. Instead of excess attack granting bonus damage, you gain +2 to the contested STR roll for every 5 points above the attack target.

**Grapple —** Attempting to begin a grapple is a special attack that costs 2 AP and occurs when one or more characters attempt to grab hold of and restrain another character. Only the character or group of characters that is in control of the grapple can take actions other than attempting to gain control.

To initiate a grapple simply make a contested grapple check against your opponent. The winner of the contested roll decides whether to engage in the grapple or end it immediately. If they choose to engage, they gain control of the grapple and can take actions within the grapple normally in initiative. Any character that is not in control of the grapple is considered pinned and must attempt to gain control at the beginning of their turn for 1 AP. If they are unsuccessful, they remain pinned and cannot take any other actions.

If another character wishes to enter in an active grapple, they must spend 2 AP to do so as if initiating. Such characters may resist or aid other actions, following the same rules as contested rolls with multiple combatants.

### Actions in a Grapple

**In Control —** Move up to 10ft in any direction (3 AP), Attack (only if unarmed or while using a light weapon) (3 AP), End Grapple (1 AP), Toss opponent up to 10ft with successful STR roll (3 AP)

**Pinned —** Gain control (3AP) by winning a contested grapple check. If there are multiple opponents in the grapple and you are successful choose one to consider pinned, the rest will be considered aiding.

**Aiding —** Attempt to gain control as if pinned, or leave the grapple for 3 AP.

**Shatter — 3 AP —** As a special attack, you may attempt to shatter an item held or worn by your opponent with a melee weapon that you are proficient with. Make a standard attack roll, if successful you deal damage to the item or object being targeted rather than your opponent. See the Equipment section for more on damaged and broken weapons, armor, and objects.

**Stand — 1AP —** Standing from a prone position costs 1 AP and may provoke an attack of opportunity.

**Surprise Attack —** Characters who are have not yet engaged in combat (who have not acted in initiative) or who are otherwise unable to defend themselves are vulnerable to surprise attacks, lowering the target value used when attacking them by one. Making a surprise attack counts as a special attack action, but requires no additional AP other than that of the attack type being used.

**Trip — 3 AP —** As a special attack, you may attempt to trip your opponent for 3 AP with a melee weapon that you are proficient with. Make a standard attack roll, if successful you make a contested STR roll against your opponent's AGI. Success causes your opponent to fall prone. Instead of excess attack granting bonus damage, you gain +2 to the contested STR roll for every 5 points above the attack target.

**Unarmed Attacks —** Unarmed attacks act as standard attacks; however, their damage is reduced to half. Roll damage and add modifiers as normal, then divide the result in half and round down before applying damage reduction.

## Defensive Actions

**Ready Action —** During your turn you may choose to withhold all actions and prepare to take an action in response to a specific queue. Both the action and response must be declared at this time. When the triggering effect takes place, you complete your action in response to it.

**Stealth —** Stealth actions often do not require additional AP. To move silently costs the same as a move action. To hide behind an object costs the same as taking cover behind it would. Stealth actions usually result in an AGI check to avoid detection. In most cases, this applies to opponents within 60ft of you who would be able to see or hear you, or who are within line of sight and actively seeking (such as a guard in a watchtower). For general stealth checks, the target starts at 15. If someone is actively searching, they may make an INS roll against your AGI.

**Step —** Once during your turn you can move one space (5ft) for 1 AP at any time as a defensive action.

**Use Cover —** Using obstacles to block the path between yourself and your opponent makes you harder to hit. Cover is dependent on 3 factors:

How much of the defender does the object block?
How much of the defender is visible to the attacker?
Can the attack being made go through the obstacle and still be effective?

Based on these factors there are two forms of cover during combat: Partial cover and full cover.

Partial cover is granted when at least half the defender's body is behind a solid object the attack cannot penetrate, or when at least half of the defender's body is hidden from view.

Full cover is granted when the defender's entire body is behind a solid object that an attack cannot penetrate. Opponents must bypass this cover in some way to land an attack, which sometimes means destroying the object itself first, or using an attack/ability that targets the space rather than the character. In addition, a character behind full cover cannot declare attacks on those on the opposite side of their cover. They must first move to partial cover to declare their attack, leaving themselves somewhat vulnerable while they do so.

The use of available cover is assumed during combat. Shifting from one type of cover to another may be done as part of a move action, or for 1 AP if your character is staying in the same location.

Keep in mind that an object may provide a different level of cover against attackers that are spread out.
