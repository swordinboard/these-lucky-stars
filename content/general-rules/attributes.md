# Character Attributes

## Attributes

Attributes act as your primary stat block, the building blocks of your character that act as a base for their other stats. They are divided into two categories: physical attributes and mental attributes.

For ease of reference attributes are often written as two numbers, the temporary value after modifiers and the base value before modifiers.

Attribute checks are used for any action that does not directly have another stat affecting it. The attribute used is determined by the GM, based on the player's description of their action.

## Two Ways to Determine Attributes

### Roll Your Attributes
Roll 1d6 and 1d4, then subtract the lower result from the higher result. If both dice show the same number, reroll both dice. Repeat this process until you have a total of 8 values, one to be assigned to each attribute. I.e. If I roll a 2 on my d6 and a 4 on my d4, I subtract 4-2, to get a value of 2.

### Attribute Pool
Using the rolling method above, each player rolls 8 attribute values and adds them to a pool for the entire party. The party then distributes the pool of attribute values across all characters as they see fit. It should be noted that this gives the party the opportunity to adapt the Luck stat however they like.

## Maximum and Minimum Attribute Values

**Max without modifiers = character level +4**

**Minimum before unconsciousness = 0**

The lowest an attribute can be is 0. If an attribute falls below 0 due to attribute damage or loss at any time the character immediately loses consciousness. A modifier to an attribute, such as a penalty from armor, that causes an attribute to fall below 0 does not cause unconsciousness, only attribute damage or loss.

Some creatures have null attributes. Null attributes are effectively 0, however cannot be raised or lowered.

### Fortitude (FORT)
