# Base Mechanic & Target Numbers

## Core Resolution System

In most situations when determining success and failure, the following mechanic is used:

**D20 + Stat + Modifiers vs. Target Number**

This is the fundamental resolution system for These Lucky Stars RPG.

### How it Works

1. **Roll a 20-sided die**
2. **Add your relevant attribute** (STR, AGI, DEX, etc.)
3. **Add any applicable modifiers** (bonuses, penalties, equipment)
4. **Compare the total to the target number**
5. **If you meet or exceed the target, you succeed**

## Determining Target Numbers

The target number is based on a difficulty scale that represents how challenging the action is to perform.

### How GMs Set Target Numbers

- **Simple Tasks:** Basic, everyday actions
- **Challenging Tasks:** Actions requiring skill or effort (default for attacks and stealth: **15**)
- **Strenuous Tasks:** Very difficult actions requiring expertise
- **"Impossible" Tasks:** Things that cannot normally be attempted

### Modifying Difficulty

**Situational advantages/disadvantages move the target up or down the scale:**

- **Using inappropriate tools** (screwdriver as hammer) → Target moves UP
- **Environmental factors** → Target moves UP or DOWN
- **Character conditions** → Usually moves target UP

### Special Cases

**Attack Rolls:** All attack and stealth rolls start at **15**
- Advantages to defender → Target moves UP
- Advantages to attacker → Target moves DOWN

**"Impossible" Tasks:** Reserved for things that would be impossible to achieve normally (lifting a train car, running on clouds, etc.). The GM decides whether to allow attempts at this difficulty level.

## Success and Failure

### When You Succeed
- **Equal or exceed the target** → Success
- **GM describes what happens** → Play continues
- **Ties go to the roller** (think of target as minimum needed)

### When You Fail
- **Roll below the target** → Failure
- **GM describes what happens** → Play continues
- **Contested rolls that tie** → Reroll

### Describing Results

The further your roll is from the target number, the more dramatic the result:

- **Much higher than target:** Completed with ease or flair
- **Just barely made it:** Succeeded just in time
- **Close miss:** Just barely missing the mark
- **Much lower than target:** Dramatic failure or struggle
