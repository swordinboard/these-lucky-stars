### Initiative = AGI + DEX + INS
How swiftly a character reacts to a surprise situation, initiative determines the order in which turns will be taken during combat. Initiative is determined at the beginning of combat, characters who have not yet had their first turn are considered out of combat and are vulnerable to surprise attacks. See the section on Combat for more details.

### Action Points = 4 (Base)
Action Points (AP) are spent during combat to take actions. The more complicated or the more time consuming an action is, the more AP the action uses. All characters start with 4 AP. See Actions in Combat for more on Action Points.

### Speed = 20 + 5 per 2 AGI Bonus or Flat -5 if AGI Penalty
Speed is a measurement of the normal walking or running speed of a character, conveniently rounded to 5ft spaces. The speed equation provided is used to describe a character or creature's primary mode of travel (in most cases it is Speed(ground) for those that live on land).

The descriptor of the speed determines what type of movement or terrain the speed applies to:
– **Ground** is the standard, for walking and running upon the ground. Most characters have a ground speed.
– **Climb** refers to how fast one climbs vertical surfaces.
– **Swim** refers to how fast one moves through water.
– **Fly** refers to how fast one moves through the air. A fly speed also has maneuverability, (High(0), Medium(+2), or Low(+4)) that determines how many spaces are required for a character to make a 90° turn. To determine how many spaces are required, add the corresponding maneuverability number to the character's size. The arc is then traced forward and to the side that many spaces. The minimum number of spaces is 1.

### Defense = AGI Bonus + FORT Bonus
Defense (DEF) is a measurement of how well a character can react to a situation to avoid dangers. When a successful attack is made, damage is dealt to the defender's DEF. Once a character loses all their DEF, they lose one point of Vitality, their DEF is reset, and the process repeats until no damage remains to be dealt. DEF is reset anytime Vitality loss is dealt, or when a character is considered safe from combat (GM discretion, usually when combat ends or the character gains total cover or is hidden from all opponents). An in-world example of DEF resetting may be described as when a character readies themselves or regains their composure after receiving/dodging blows. See Combat for more details on DEF, VIT, and wounds.

### Vitality = ½ Level + ½ Max FORT (Total Rounded Down, Min 1)
Vitality represents a character's overall health and endurance of ailments. The more Vitality a character has, the more they can carry on through illness and wounds before succumbing to them. In combat, Vitality (VIT) represents the number of blows a character can take before being incapacitated. Taking multiple points of VIT damage from a single attack also causes the character to receive a wound or condition. When a character's VIT reaches 0 they fall unconscious. The attacker may choose the final blow to be lethal or non-lethal (if there is no attacker the GM decides). If they choose lethal, the character gains the dying condition and must pass a FORT check at the beginning of each of their turns. The target begins at 5, and increases by 1 each round. If this roll is failed, the character dies. 1 VIT is recovered with a week of rest. Because VIT uses the character's max FORT, it is not affected by FORT damage. See Combat for more details on DEF, VIT, and wounds.

### Wounds and Conditions
A wound is a physical injury, usually brought on by an attack or other damaging effect. Wounds may be received from any of three sources:
- An attack that goes beyond the target number by 10 or more and deals VIT damage.
- An attack that deals 2 or more VIT damage.
- Loss of a character's final VIT point.

A Condition is part of a broad category of effects that can come from a variety of sources, including attacks, abilities, stress, VIT loss, and environment.

### Stress Threshold = ½ Level + ½ WILL (Total Rounded Down, Min 1)
Your character's Stress Threshold represents the amount of stress they can endure before it takes a toll on their actions. Stress can be gained from a variety of sources such as abilities, conditions, and failed rolls. When a character's Stress level reaches their threshold, they gain the stressed condition.

### Luck = 5 + Party Attribute Modifiers (Min 1)
Luck points can be used to add 1d4 to any d20 roll. Luck points replenish with a rest. Character features or other effects may allow luck to be used in additional ways. Temporary mods/damage to attributes does not affect total Luck. Your total Luck is dependent on your party. To calculate the number of Luck points your character has during character creation, begin with 5 points and use the table to determine any modifiers. Each player works their way down the table and compares their attributes to the rest of the party. If the statement in the left column is true about your character adjust your Luck by the amount corresponding to that statement. Each character may be affected my multiple Luck adjustments, or none at all. If a tie is presented by any number of characters, those characters are all effected by the adjustment.

| Of the party, your character has the... | Luck = 5... |
|------------------------------------------|-------------|
| Highest attribute total | -2 |
| Lowest attribute total | +2 |
| Highest physical attribute total | -1 |
| Lowest physical attribute total | +1 |
| Highest mental attribute total | -1 |
| Lowest mental attribute total | +1 |

### Grapple = STR + AGI
Used when engaging in a grapple with an opponent in the form of a contested D20 roll. Though rare, grappling with multiple opponents or allies is possible and follows the same rules as other contested rolls. See Special Attacks in the Combat section for more details.

### Stealth
Like many other rolls, Stealth checks are made using different attributes based on the action being taken. Modifiers to stealth are common from armor and character features.

### Blank Boxes
The character sheet has a pair of blank boxes to add common modifiers based on game/character. It may be helpful to have a reference for actions such as pilot, drive, charge, disarm, or intimidate.

### Attack = STR or DEX
The attribute used while making an attack (ATK) varies depending on the type of weapon being used and the type of attack being made. As such, attack values are located in the weapons block on the character sheet. In most cases, melee attacks will use STR while ranged attacks will use DEX.

## Size

Size is designed to be relative to the party and scale of the world being played in. In most cases, the party will be of average human height and be working in a world designed for that.

The size scale works in half steps. This means creatures that are ½ the general height of the party's average are a size smaller, and those that are 2x the average are a size larger. Final interpretation is up to the GM and is not meant to be taken to exact measurements from the average. If the average party is 5ft 6in, playing in a world designed for humans, a small creature may simply be described as being under 3ft, and a large one over 10ft. Each size has a number associated with it describing how far up or down the scale it is from average party height. The base size for the majority of the party should be Medium/0.

Attacks and damage are dependent on comparable size. In short, smaller characters are harder to hit, and larger characters hit harder. Size also influences physical attributes. Larger and smaller characters are affected by modifiers as shown on the Character Size Chart.
